.SH NAME
.B png2pos
is a utility to convert PNG images to ESC/POS format

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B png2pos
[-V] [-h] [-c] [-a L|C|R] [-r] [-t THRESHOLD] [-p] [-o FILE] input files

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B png2pos
is a utility to convert PNG images to ESC/POS format (printer control codes and escape sequences) used by POS thermal printers. Output file can be just sent to printer.
.P
It accepts any PNG file (B/W, greyscale, RGB, RGBA), applies Histogram Equalization Algorithm and via Atkinson Dithering Algorithm converts it to B/W bitmap wrapped by ESC/POS commands.
.B png2pos
prepends needed printer initialization binary sequences and adds paper cutoff command, if requested.
.P
.B png2pos
utilizes ESC@, GSV, GSL, GS8L and GS(L ESC/POS commands.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-V"
display the version number and exit

.IP "\-h"
display this short help and exit

.IP "\-c"
cut the paper at the end of job

.IP "\-a L|C|R"
horizontal image alignment (Left, Center, Right)

.IP "\-r"
rotate image upside down before it is printed

.IP "\-t THRESHOLD"
set the treshold value for conversion to B/W, falling back to the default value 0x80 if not set. THRESHOLD must be in the interval <0; 255>, the lower value set, the more bright output created. Value may include a "0x" prefix, and the number will be read in base 16, a "0" prefix for base 8 (octal); otherwise, a 10 (decimal) base is taken.

.IP "\-p"
switch to photo mode (pre-process input files)

.IP "\-o FILE"
output file
.nf
With no FILE, or when FILE is -, write to standard output

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.B png2pos
uses a common convention of zero (0) for success and non-zero (> 0) for error.
